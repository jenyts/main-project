in python everything is built using class

object oreinted programming 

one of the unique python specification of python is that python supports all different programming paradigms
funstional
object oreineted programming
procedural programming

homework
difference btwn functional oop and procedural programming


what and why objects

in real world we use objects .
like to call someone you need your phone
or to eat food you use your plates

so in real world everything is an object

here we consider person as an object too

like if u have a company and u have emplooyes to work on projects every emplooyes can be
considered as an object
and some emplooye object may use laptops which are also objects

so everything is an object even person we treat them as an object


object will have 2 things

every object will have attributes
every object will have behaviours

attributes

if i am an object my name can be an attribute my height can be a attribute etc

things u know about an object

behaviour

when it comes to behavious i can walk i can sing am swimming am talking
each can be considered as my behaviour

thing an object does



in objects attributes are basicaly data that defines an object
in python we store data in variables
so attribute  data values are stored in variables


if u want to define the behaviour we need to use methods

so what are methods
so we know what functions are right

functions in object oriented programming are called methods

its similar but when we are using oop we need to thing in object term



in oops we have different concepts like
-object 
-class
-encapsulation
-Abstraction
-Polymorphism


classes
Classes provide a means of bundling data and functionality together.
In object-oriented programming, a class is a template definition of the methods and variables in a particular kind of object. Thus, an object is a specific instance of a class; it contains real values instead of variables. 
The class is one of the defining ideas of object-oriented programming.

so basically class is a design/blueprint


so if we want an object we need to create a class



so how do we create a class
 the way we define a function is bye using the def function name
 similarly we define a class using class keyword

 eg class Car:
        attributes-->variables
        behaviours-->methods(function)
